# GifTastic

GIFTastic is a HTML/Javascript application that calls upon the Giphy API and uses Bootstrap and Jquery for rendering. A search field is provided to restrict the search as well as inserting a new quick-search button. 
Clicking on the images starts and stops the GIF animation.

Future Improvements:

While this project certainly lends itself to further development, it is meant as a demonstrator; hence, none is foreseen at this time.
It can, however, be reused and manipulated as a module in conjunction with other technologies.
